###Welcome

This is the repository for work in progress on the Handbook on Monitoring Access and Benefit-Sharing under the Nagoya Protocol. Please visit the [Handbook website](https://poldham.github.io/abs/) to access the articles. 

The Handbook is written in Rmarkdown in RStudio and the files and accompanying data can be downloaded from the repository. As the project is at an early stage please anticipate significant changes to the content and project structure.
